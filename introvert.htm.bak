				<p> Hello! I am Rinoa Rochelle D Carmona. <br>
					I am a 2nd year student at DFCAMCLP, taking my Bachelors in Information System. <br> 
					I am 19 years old, although I do turn 20 in a few months.<br>
					I live in Las Pinas City! Though I won't specifically say my address because its unnecessary. <br>
					Hmm... What else do I talk about? Goals in life? Well-<br>
					<br><br>
					I aspired to be a writer, I love writing to the point I don't think I can call it a hobby. <br>
					Writing is a passion I wish I could act upon, one I could prioritize, but being an IT student does have its perks. <br> 
					Since being an IT student, if I were to study hard, then that means I'll probably find a stable and good job, <br>
					which in turn means I'll be able to provide for my little sister so she'll be able to have a choice in what she <br>
					wants to become! <br>
					<br><br>
					Oh, it seems I forgot a few details before I talked about my goals in life! Wekll then- <br>
					I am the eldest daughter, me having a little sister. My mom and dad both work so I stay at home to take care of <br>
					my little sister and our dog. <br> 
					I suppose that's it, isn't it?
					<br> <br>
